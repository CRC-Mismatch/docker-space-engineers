## Space Engineers on Docker

PixPan Studios presents Space Engineers on Docker.  It utilizes the [microsoft/windowsservercore:1803](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/windowsservercore/) windows container image.  

## Usage

If there is a new Space Engineers server release, simply redeploy the container.

```
docker run \
    -t \
    -i \
    -d \
    -p 27016:27016/udp \
    -v </path/to/server-instance>:C:/data \
    pixpan/space-engineers
```

## Structure

This image is designed to self-update both SteamCMD and Space Engineers everytime a container is created or started.  This is a departure from the "Docker Way", however is necessary due to a current lack of visibility for updates.

## Automated Build
This automated build is done on Travis-CI as it is (currently) the only free-to-use Open Source platform that supports Windows build machines.  If you wish to fork this project, be sure to create `$docker_username` and `$docker_password` to Travis as secret environment variables.
